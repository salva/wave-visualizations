# Wave Visualizations

**Work in Progress**

## Overview

This project offers a growing collection of interactive visualizations to explore the principles of wave mechanics and interference. It is designed to support teaching, self-study, and experimentation by providing clear, intuitive simulations backed by physical insights.

## Included Visualizations

### 🌊 [1. Phase Displacement in Traveling Waves](phase-displacement.html)

An animated visualization that demonstrates how the phase of a traveling wave depends on both **position** and **time**. It shows how different points along the wave oscillate with the same frequency but varying phase, and includes a circular motion analogy for better intuition.

**Key concepts illustrated:**
- Phase = function of position and time
- Sinusoidal wave behavior
- Connection to uniform circular motion

### 🌈 [2. Double-Slit Interference Simulation](interference.html)

An interactive simulation inspired by the classic double-slit experiment. It shows two coherent sources emitting waves toward a screen, producing an interference pattern based on path differences.

**Adjustable parameters:**
- Wall distance (distance to detection screen)
- Separation between holes (slit spacing)
- Wave amplitude
- Wave frequency

**Key concepts illustrated:**
- Constructive and destructive interference
- Real-time formation of interference patterns
- Relationship between wave properties and spatial distribution

## Features

- 🎛️ **Interactive Controls** – Modify physical parameters and immediately observe their effect on wave patterns.
- 📈 **Graphical Output** – Real-time rendering of wave behavior, including amplitudes and interference outcomes.
- 📚 **Educational Descriptions** – In-page explanations support conceptual understanding of each phenomenon.

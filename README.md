# Wave Visualizations

**Work in Progress**

## Overview

This project offers a growing collection of interactive visualizations to explore the principles of wave mechanics and interference. It is designed to support teaching, self-study, and experimentation by providing clear, intuitive simulations backed by physical insights.

## Included Visualizations

### 🌊 [1. Phase Displacement in Traveling Waves](phase-displacement.html)

An animated visualization that demonstrates how the phase of a traveling wave depends on both **position** and **time**. It shows how different points along the wave oscillate with the same frequency but varying phase, and includes a circular motion analogy for better intuition.

**Key concepts illustrated:**
- Phase = function of position and time
- Sinusoidal wave behavior
- Connection to uniform circular motion

### 🌈 [2. Double-Slit Interference Simulation](interference.html)

An interactive simulation inspired by the classic double-slit experiment. It shows two coherent sources emitting waves toward a screen, producing an interference pattern based on path differences.

**Adjustable parameters:**
- Wall distance (distance to detection screen)
- Separation between holes (slit spacing)
- Wave amplitude
- Wave frequency

**Key concepts illustrated:**
- Constructive and destructive interference
- Real-time formation of interference patterns
- Relationship between wave properties and spatial distribution

### 🌌 [3. Coherent Wave Source Interference](interference-space.html)

An interactive visualization demonstrating wave interference from two coherent sources. This simulation allows you to adjust parameters like wavelength, source distance, phase shift, and amplitude ratio to explore their effects on resulting wave patterns.

**Adjustable parameters:**
- Wavelength of the waves
- Distance between sources
- Phase shift between sources
- Amplitude ratio of the sources
- Distance attenuation

**Key concepts illustrated:**
- Superposition principle in wave mechanics
- Variation of wave patterns based on source configurations
- Concepts of wave amplitude and phase

## Features

- 🎛️ **Interactive Controls** – Modify physical parameters and immediately observe their effect on wave patterns.
- 📈 **Graphical Output** – Real-time rendering of wave behavior, including amplitudes and interference outcomes.
- 📚 **Educational Descriptions** – In-page explanations support conceptual understanding of each phenomenon.

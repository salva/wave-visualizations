# Wave Visualizations

**WIP!!!**

## Project Overview

This project provides a collection of diagrams and visual representations that illustrate the fundamental concepts of wave behavior and interferences. It is designed to aid in understanding the principles of wave mechanics through interactive simulations and detailed visual explanations.

## Features

- **Interactive Wave Simulations:** Visualize wave interferences and patterns by manipulating parameters such as wave amplitude, frequency, and slit spacing.
- **Diagrams and Graphs:** Comprehensive illustrations to explain wave phenomena, including constructive and destructive interference, standing waves, and amplitude modulation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive controls for users to experiment with wave properties and observe their effects in real-time.

## Interferences

In this section, we explore how waves interact with each other. The key concepts include:

- **Constructive Interference:** When two waves meet in phase, their amplitudes add up to create a larger wave.
- **Destructive Interference:** When waves meet out of phase, they can cancel each other out, resulting in reduced amplitude or complete cancellation.

Through interactive diagrams, users can visualize both scenarios and better understand wave interactions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You will need a modern browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wave-visualizations.git
cd wave-visualizations
open index.html
```

## Usage

1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Adjust the parameters such as wall distance, slit spacing, wave amplitude, and wave frequency via the input controls.
3. Observe how these changes affect the wave patterns and interference results in real-time.

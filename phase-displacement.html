    <h1>Phase Displacement in Traveling Waves</h1>

      <h2>What This Animation Shows</h2>
      <p>This animation illustrates a fundamental concept in wave physics: the phase of a wave at any given point is a function of both <strong>position</strong> and <strong>time</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Left Panel: Traveling Wave</h2>
      <p>The left plot shows a traveling wave, typically described by the function:</p>
      <pre>y(x, t) = A · sin(kx - ωt)</pre>
      <p>Here, the <strong>phase</strong> <code>(kx - ωt)</code> depends on both position <code>x</code> and time <code>t</code>. Three points on the wave (red, green, blue) show how displacement changes with time at different fixed positions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each vertical dashed line marks a fixed position along the wave.</li>
        <li>The vertical displacement of each point varies sinusoidally over time, but not synchronously — because the phase depends on <em>where</em> the point is on the wave.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Right Panel: Circular Motion Analogy</h2>
      <p>The right plot represents each point's motion as a projection of a rotating vector (phasor) around a circle. The angular position around the circle reflects the phase at each location:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The red, green, and blue vectors rotate at the same angular speed (frequency), but with different initial angles, because each has a different spatial phase offset.</li>
        <li>This helps visualize why even though all points oscillate with the same frequency, they do so out of phase with each other.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The animation shows that in a traveling wave, <strong>the phase at each point is not only a function of time, but also of position</strong>. This is why the wave form travels through space, rather than oscillating in place.</p>
